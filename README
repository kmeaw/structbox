Typed function call checker.

Values have (are instances of) types.
Functions map values of the input (argument) type to values of the output type.
Partial order (<=, subtype) is defined on types. Each type is it's own subtype.
Type can check (validate) if a value belongs to that type.
Some types are parametric - such types are distinct unless a certian condition is met.
During the pipeline construction, type checker runs the validation procedure for
each function which takes argument values and produces function's input (manifest)
and output types. Then arguments are validated by the manifest.
Some types can be instantiated (converted to corresponding values) to advance the
type checker to the next function.
Pipe is a special parametric type which values are not allowed
to be processed during the type checking.
